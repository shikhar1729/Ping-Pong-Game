# Ping-Pong-Game
The classic Atari Ping Pong Game implemented on Atmel Atmega16 Development Board.

Using a 8x8  monochrome Red LED matrix (MAX 7219).
Simple pushbuttons for user control.
Scoreboard using 7-segment displays.
The buzzer was also programmed for producing sound.
The game also has a reset.
The buzzer produces annoying sound using PWM whenever someone scores a point. It also plays a melody at the start of the game.

The game can be powered either by a battery or by connecting to a PC through a USB cable.

The file 'final.c' is the final game implementation

Also added Proteus ISIS file 'avr_matrix.DSN' for simulation.
